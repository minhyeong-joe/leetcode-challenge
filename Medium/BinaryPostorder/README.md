# Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)

## Problem:

Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

## Example:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]
```

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

## Note:

- The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
