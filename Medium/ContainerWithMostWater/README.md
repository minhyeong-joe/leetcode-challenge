# Container With Most Water

[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

## Problem:

Given n non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` , where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line `i` is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

_Notice_ that you may not slant the container.

## Example:

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

```
Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
