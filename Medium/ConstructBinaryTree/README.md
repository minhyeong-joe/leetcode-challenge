[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/)

## Problem:

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

## Example:

```
Given:
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]

Returns following binary tree:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

## Note:

You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.
