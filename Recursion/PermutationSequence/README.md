# Permutation Sequence

[Leetcode Link](#)

## Problem:

The set `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for `n = 3`:

1. `"123"`
2. `"132"`
3. `"213"`
4. `"231"`
5. `"312"`
6. `"321"`
   Given `n` and `k`, return the `k`\_th permutation sequence.

## Example:

```
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```

```
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```

```
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: "123"
```

## Note:

- `1 <= n <= 9`
- `1 <= k <= n!`
