# 0-1 Knapsack

## Problem:

Given `weights`: list of weights where `weights[i]` represents the weight of `i-th` item,
`values` : list of values where `values[i]` represents the value of `i-th` item,
and `W`, total weight available,
Find the maximum values that can be achieved within the limit of total weight.

## Example:

```
Input: weights = [4, 5, 2, 3]
       values =  [5, 3, 2, 4]
       W = 7
Output: 9
```
