# Minimum Path Sum (**MODIFIED**)

[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)

## Problem:

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

**modified**: You can move either down or right _or bottom-right (i+1, j+1)_

## Example:

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],
               [4,8,2],
               [1,5,3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 2 → 2 → 3 minimizes the sum.
```
