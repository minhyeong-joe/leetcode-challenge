# Unbounded Knapsack

## Problem:

Given `weights`: list of weights where `weights[i]` represents the weight of `i-th` item,
`values` : list of values where `values[i]` represents the value of `i-th` item,
and `capacity`, total capacity available,
Find the maximum values that can be achieved within the limit of total weight.

**same items can be used multiple times**

## Example:

```
weights = [1,2,3,5]
values =  [1,4,7,10]
capacity = 8
Output: 18
```
