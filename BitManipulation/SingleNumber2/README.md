[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)

## Problem:

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

## Example:

```
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```
```
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```
