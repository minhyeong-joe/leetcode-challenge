# Increasing Triplet Subsequence
[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/)

## Problem:

Given an unsorted array return whether an increasing subsequence of length 3 exists or not in the array.

Formally the function should:
```
Return true if there exists i, j, k
such that arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] given 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n-1 else return false.
```
## Example:

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true
```
```
Input: [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: false
```

## Note:

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
